# SassDoc

The Sass documentation is generated with [SassDoc](http://sassdoc.com). You can find the Sass documentation at [/sassdoc/](/sassdoc/). Be careful, the trailing slash matters.

The Sass documentation is generated on build. If you want to regenerate the Sass documentation locally, you can run `gulp sassdoc`.
