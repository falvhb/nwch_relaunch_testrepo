# Example Form

This shows how one could use input components on the website. Each component has a callback that fires when the value changes, which can be used by the parent form to track state.

There's still a problem with this approach, the main form is still unaware of values and fields that have not been "changed" as of now (for example initial values). This is still WIP.
