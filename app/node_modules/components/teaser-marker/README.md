# Teaser Marker

Renders a *marker* for the `Teaser` component which displays over the image. It is only applied in a couple of cases such as for `video_autoplay` and `publi_reportage` article `labeltype`s (themes).

Component accepts `text` and `icon` properties, with the `icon` property being the icon ID to render in a child `Icon` component. Styling and positioning is dependent on the theme of the teaser, and styled in that teaser's theme file.
