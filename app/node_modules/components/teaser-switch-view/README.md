# Teaser

The `Teaser` isomorphic component is a block aiming at featuring an article, usually displaying the title, the catchword and a date, but this content may vary on the type of teaser. It can also (and often does) feature the main image for the article.

There are 11 different variations of the teaser. The variation can be changed with the `modifier` property, accepting one of these values:

- `basic`: the basic one containing a picture, primary, secondary and
tertiary content.
- `basic-listed`: on viewports less than 500px this is the `inlined-left` variation. On larger viewports, this is the `basic` variation.
- `light`: a variation with an image, but with a top border instead.
- `light-boxed`: like `light` variation except it sits on a light-grey
background, giving an idea of boxed content.
- `plain`: most simple and versatile teaser variation, title and catchword only.
- `plain-inverted`: inverted plain teaser variation for use on dark backgrounds, title and catchword only.
- `inlined-left`: a variation with the image floated on the left.
- `inlined-right`: a variation with the image floated on the right.
- `listed`: a variation meant to be displayed in list of teasers, containing a slight background.
- `large`: a large variation where the content sits on top of the image, used for featured articles
- `mega`: a variation where the content sits centered on top of the image, for use in the `MegaTeaser`
- `meinung`: featuring an avatar-style image and quote block meant for opinion pieces.

The `Teaser` component is also a fully-scoped Article microdata itemtype. It should contain every required itemprop, although where visible content is not available, extra microdata can be added through the `schema` prop.

## Teaser Configuration

Teasers are commonly called via `<tal:>` includes in the CMS for more effective caching. Here a raw article is passed from the API to [`slot.js`](/app/node_modules/components/teaser/slot.js), and data is mapped and passed into the `Teaser` component.

As the full API response is large, the [`getTeaserFromArticle`](/app/node_modules/helpers/teaser/get-from-article.jsx) helper in `slot.js` maps only the data the `Teaser` component actually needs based on the variation / modifier.

Here you can also configure a `theme` which is an additional BEM modifier on the teaser. At present there are two: `theme-default` and `theme-inverted`, with the inverted theme used for `mega` and `plain-inverted` teaser variations to switch the text color and rollovers to white.
