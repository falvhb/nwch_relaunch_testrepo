# Teaser

The `Teaser` isomorphic component is a block aiming at featuring an article, usually displaying the title, the catchword and a date, but this content may vary on the type of teaser. It can also (and often does) feature the main image for the article.

There are 6 different variations of the teaser. The variation can be changed with the `modifier` property, accepting one of these values:

- `basic`: the basic one containing a picture, primary, secondary and
tertiary content.
- `light`: a variation with an image, but with a top border instead.
- `light-boxed`: like `light` variation except it sits on a light-grey
background, giving an idea of *boxed* content.
- `inlined`: a variation with the image floated on the side, perfect for list
representations.
- `listed`: a variation meant to be displayed in list of teasers.
- `large`: a large variation where the content sits on top of the image,
layered with a transparent black background for readibility.
- `promoted`: a large variation that can be themed, perfect for home pages
and heavily promoted teasers.

The `Teaser` component is also a fully-scoped Article microdata itemtype. It should contain every required itemprop, although where visible content is not available, extra microdata can be added through the `schema` prop.
