# Rule CTA

The `RuleCta` component is, at the minimum, a horizontal rule.

If `url` and `label` props are passed in, a blue CTA link will be created and floated to the right.

If `_event` and `label` props are passed in, a blue CTA button will be created and styled similarly. The button's `onClick` handler is set to `_event`.

Both the link and button variations support an icon ID, too.
