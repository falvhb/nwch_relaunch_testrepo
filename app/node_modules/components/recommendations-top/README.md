# Recommendations Top

The `RecommendationsTop` component renders a list of recommended reading although is never called itself. Markup for this component must be copied and added to the `node-article` layout in the CMS, with each `Teaser` called from a `<tal:>` include.

On larger viewports, these article teasers float to the left of the page. On smaller viewports, only the first two teasers are displayed to conserve space. Upon clicking “Mehr Artikel”, the remaining teasers are shown.
