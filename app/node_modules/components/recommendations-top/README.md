# Recommendations Top

The `RecommendationsTop` component renders a list of recommended reading although is never called itself. Markup for this component must be copied and added to the `node-article` layout in the CMS, with each `Teaser` called from a `<tal:>` include.

On larger viewports, these article teasers float to the left of the page. On smaller viewports, only the first two teasers are displayed to conserve space. Upon clicking “Mehr Artikel”, the remaining teasers are shown.

**Note:** Because of the way the component is rendered via CMS markup and Teaser slots we have to provide client-side JS for the expand feature separately from React. We do this via [`recommendations-top.js`](/app/clientside/recommendations-top.js) in the `/clientside` folder, and include it in [`client.js`](/app/client.js) for this component.

Ideally we would include one component via `<tal:>` include which takes an array of teasers provided from the node route.
