# Topic Body

The `TopicBody` component renders a grid of 12 [`Teaser`](/styleguide/components/teaser)s.

If Javascript is supported on the client and there are greater than 12 article, this component will support an infinite loading mechanism. Alternatively it will fall back to static pagination using [`TopicPagination`](/styleguide/components/topic-pagination).
