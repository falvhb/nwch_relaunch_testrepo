# Typography 

The basis of any newspaper should be excellent typography. With that in mind, we have chosen two typefaces for an optimum and pleasant on screen reading experience — Publico & Colfax.

With it’s narrow proportions, Publico is an ideal text face. From Publico Headline to Publico Text, elegance gives way to sturdiness in the serifs and less pronounced ball terminals, making for an even, comfortable sturucture in text. The site currently uses Publico Headline Medium, Publico Text – Regular, Bold & Italic. The Publico font stack is: Publico, Georgia and then serif.

Colfax is technically a geometric sans-serif but was designed with so-called ‘implied geometry’, that is referenced throughout the typeface, giving it a pleasant sturdiness. The Colfax font stack is: Colfax, Helvetica, Arial and then sans-serif.
