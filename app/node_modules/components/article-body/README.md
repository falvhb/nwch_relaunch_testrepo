# Article Body

Text and content for the article from the CMS, including all Störers / Enrichments and Curated Recommendations. Parsing takes place given the two strings placed in the WYSIWYG editor content:

- **${{stoerer}}** (Störers / Enrichments)
- **${{stoerer}}** (Curated Recommendations)

All content is parsed from the `text`, `enrichments` and `curated` keys from the API response.
