# Responsive Image

Include any image served from the [Goldbach Image Proxy](https://cms.azbe.lovelysystems.com/docs/mobile_imageproxy.html) with responsive formats. Always pass `alt` and `title` attributes to the image where appropriate.

## Sizing

Pass a required image size to the component based on where it is used in the content i.e. `size="large"` or `size="full"` and an appropriate image variation (width) is served given the user's viewport. Available sizes are:

* `tiny`
* `small`
* `large`
* `full`

**Ratios and sizes are interchangeable**

Images will always stretch to fit their container, with a `max-width` constraint so they do not get larger than the source image.

## Ratios

You can also request images in different ratios, cropped to fit. Available ratios are:

* `1x1`
* `4x3`
* `3x2`
* `16x9` (default)
* `9x4`

**Ratios and sizes are interchangeable**

## Enhancements

`<picture>` and `srcSet` is used to serve a `2x` variation to high-resoultion devices.

## Fallback

Users without Javascript will be served a `<picture>` element with `source` variations and accompanying media queries, inside a `<noscript>` element (not requested on first-load by users with JS).
