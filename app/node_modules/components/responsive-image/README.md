# Responsive Image

Include any image served from the [Goldbach Image Proxy](https://cms.azbe.lovelysystems.com/docs/mobile_imageproxy.html) with responsive formats. Always pass `alt` and `title` attributes to the image where appropriate.


## Sizing

Pass a required image size to the component based on where it is used in the content i.e. `size="large"` or `size="full"` and an appropriate image variation (width) is served given the user's viewport.


Images will always stretch to fit their container, with a `max-width` constraint so they do not get larger than the source image.

## Ratios

You can also request images in different ratios, cropped to fit. Available ratios are:

* `1x1`
* `4x3`
* `3x2`
* `16x9` (default)
* `9x4`

## Loading

Use the `defer={true}` flag to asynchronously / lazy load an image and not block page rendering.

## Enhancements

If the user resizes their viewport upwards, a larger image variation will be served when appropriate. Retina or `2x` images are also served to high resolution devices.

## Fallback

Users without Javascript will be served a `<picture>` element with `source` variations and accompanying media queries, inside a `<noscript>` element (not requested on first-load by users with JS).
