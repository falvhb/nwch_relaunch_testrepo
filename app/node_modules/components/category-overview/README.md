# Category Teaser

Displays 3 featured teasers for a given article category (e.g. Meinung). Full-width, with top border color and then filled with 3 x `Teaser` components;

**Note:** Because of the way the component is rendered via CMS markup and Teaser slots, there is no way to change the grid layout depending on the amount of teasers present. Ideally we would include one component via `<tal:>` include which takes an array of teasers provided from the node route.

To catch empty cells and remove them if a Teaser slot fails we use [`clear-empty-cells.js`](/app/node_modules/clientside/clear-empty-cells.js) in the `/clientside` folder, and include it in [`client.js`](/app/client.js) for this component.
