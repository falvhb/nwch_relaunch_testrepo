# Date Formatter

The `DateFormatter` component is used to manipulate and display dates. It expects a `publicationDate` property, and possibly a `modificationDate` property. The latter is used over the former in case it is passed.

It is possible to pass a `format`, which can be either `short`, `long`, `relative` or any date format valid for the [`moment.format()` function](http://momentjs.com/docs/#/displaying/format/).

When displaying a date as part of a sentence or a label, it is possible to use the `publicationFormat` and `modificationFormat` respectively. These needs to contain a `%s` token, which is where the date will actually be printed as part of the string (e.g. `publicationFormat='Published on %s'`).
