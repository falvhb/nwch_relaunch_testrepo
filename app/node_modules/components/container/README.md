# Container

The container component is just a simple wrapper for the main content sections.
A container has very few styles: a `max-width`, some horizontal `padding` and is horizontal centered in its container.

Unless you want the content to stick to the edges of the viewport, it is 
recommended to wrap it in a container so it behaves correctly on all screen 
sizes.
