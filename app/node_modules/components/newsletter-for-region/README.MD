# Newsletter for region
Displays a form for subscribing to a single newsletter tied to the a specific region. If a newsletter for that region isn't present, nothing is rendered.

## Props: regionPath
A `regionPath` needs to be supplied for the component to work, this is an array describing the region/town, for example `['aargau', 'aarau']`. This can typically be extracted from a url.

## Source of truth
The source for the newsletters is `config/newsletters.json`. Please see [NewsletterPage](/styleguide/components/newsletter-page) for more details on how this works.
