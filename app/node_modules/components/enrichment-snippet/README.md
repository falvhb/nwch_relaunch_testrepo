# HTML Snippet Enrichment

The `EnrichmentSnippet` component is used to display any HTML added by editors. Welcome to Pandora's Box!

There are some circumstance in which we modify the HTML snippet, however:
- If the HTML snippet is an `<iframe>` from Youtube or Vimeo, that `<iframe>` is wrapped in container to control its size
- If the HTML has plain trailing text, this is wrapped in a container and is considered a caption
