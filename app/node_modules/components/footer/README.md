# Footer

The main footer. This is an isomorphic component, meaning this and any of its child components can hook into client-side JS (like [FooterSections](/styleguide/components/footer-sections), for example).

These child components are rendered:
- [Footer Nav](/styleguide/components/footer-nav)
- [Footer Sections](/styleguide/components/footer-sections)
- [Footer Copyright](/styleguide/components/footer-copyright)
