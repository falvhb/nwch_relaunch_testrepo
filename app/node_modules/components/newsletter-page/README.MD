# Newsletter Page
Page that allows signups to different newsletters.

Related components:

- [NewsletterForm](/styleguide/components/newsletter-form) - submits the form fields generated by this component
- [NewsletterForRegion](/styleguide/components/newsletter-for-region).

## Source of truth
The source for the newsletters is `config/newsletters.json`. It's an object of keys corresponding to the urls on the website (region/town), for example:

```
{
  aargau: {
    aarau: {â€¦}
  }
}
```

each town's object has a number of attributes, of which most of them are reated to the items in a mailchimp form. For example, when a MailChimp form is created, the generated checkbox for one mailing list would be:

```
<input type="checkbox" value="2" name="group[5593][2]" id="mce-group[5593]-5593-1">
<label for="mce-group[5593]-5593-1">Ausgabe Baden</label>
```

In order to reproduce this inside `.config.json`, you need an object with the following attributes:

```
{
  // Mailchimp
  "id": 1,
  "group": 5593,
  // UI
  "label": "Ausgabe Aarau",
  "townName": "Aarau"
}
```

optionally, a `hidden` attribute can be set to true to hide the field from the frontend.
