# Enrichment

The `Enrichment` component is a simple wrapper for specific enrichment types. It is used for positioning the enrichment content within an article.

If aside is `true`, the enrichment will be floated to the side of the article—where possible—otherwise, it will occupy the full width. The child enrichment type must be passed as `type` too, and this is used to add styles where needed (such as HTML snippets).
