# Newsletter form
This component creates a form tag for sending things to Mailchimp. It will handle posts through javascript in the future, but for now it opens up a confirmation page on Mailchimp's side.

It is used to submit the following components:

- [NewsletterPage](/styleguide/components/newsletter-page),
- [NewsletterForRegion](/styleguide/components/newsletter-for-region).

## Optional Props (for changing the form POST url)
The Mailchimp form sends the content to a url that is constructed like this:

- https://`host`/subscribe/post?u=`u`&amp;id=`id`

For all of these things the defaults are probably right, but if for some reason they need to be overridden, that's possible.
