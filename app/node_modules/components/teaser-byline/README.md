# Teaser Byline

Renders the byline within a `Teaser` component typically containing the published date. If a `dateFormat` is passed, the component renders the `DateFormatter` component with the `text` property used as the `publicationDate`. In this case, `text` should be an ISO date string.

Modifiers from the teaser can be passed down to this component as an arry via the `modifiers` property. This allows the byline to be styled correctly based on the teaser format and theme e.g. `class="teaser-byline--large teaser-byline--ugc"`.
