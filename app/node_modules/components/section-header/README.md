# Section Header

The `SectionHeader` component accepts a title (required) and a catchword (optional). Other optonal props are `modifier` and `titleModifier` which set the modifier on the header element and the title element respectively.

Use cases for these are to invert the header if it is to lie on a dark background - `modifier={inverted}` or make the title larger - `titleModifier={large}`, used on Ressort and Topic page headers.
