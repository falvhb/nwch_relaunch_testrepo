# Image Asset

This component renders an image asset as a [ResponsiveImage](/styleguide/components/responsive-image), along with an optional caption.

The properties are taken from the API and mapped by `wrapper.jsx` into the image and caption.

Also, each instance is a fully-scoped `ImageObject` microdata itemtype.
