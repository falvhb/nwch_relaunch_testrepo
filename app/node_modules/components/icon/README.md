# Icons

Icons are used to emphasize functionality and as such are stylistically simple, bold and friendly.

This component has default styling for icons and in such a case, only the icon id is required. However in certain situiations it may be necessary to add custom styles and in this case, it is possible to pass a `className` prop.
