# Topic Detail

This is an isomorphic component. It represents the main article page called from a `<tal:>` include in the CMS, via its own node view. Data is passed via the `topic` and `articles` keys from the API response and renders the following components:

- [`TopicHeader`](/styleguide/components/topic-header)
- [`TopicBody`](/styleguide/components/topic-body)
