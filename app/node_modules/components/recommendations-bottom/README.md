# Recommendations Bottom

The `RecommendationsBottom` component renders six related article teasers although is never called itself. Markup for this component must be copied and added to the `node-article` layout in the CMS, with each `Teaser` called from a `<tal:>` include with the correct teaser variation.

**Note:** Because of the way the component is rendered via CMS markup and Teaser slots, there is no way to change the grid layout depending on the amount of teasers present. Ideally we would include one component via `<tal:>` include which takes an array of teasers provided from the node route.

To catch empty cells and remove them if a Teaser slot fails we use [`clear-empty-cells.js`](/app/clientside/clear-empty-cells.js) in the `/clientside` folder, and include it in [`client.js`](/app/client.js) for this component.
