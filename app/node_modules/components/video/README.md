# Video component

Videos are using the Kaltura Media Player. The Media Player is used in HTML5 mode per default.

@TODO: describe auto play feature.

## major tasks

@TODO: write documentation

@TODO: code review

@TODO: tests

@TODO: discuss if we need exact 16:9 ratios without having borders in the viewing area when resizing the player. The solution would be to set width and height of the iframe player dynamically on resizing the player.

## minor tasks (code fixes)

@TODO4: check kaltura library is only loaded once (is this a problem? Doesn't the browser cache it anyway?)
