# Video component

Videos are using the Kaltura Media Player. The Media Player is used in HTML5 mode per default.

A `video` has to be specified by an `accountID`, a `playerID`, a `kalturaID` for the video to be played as well as corresponding video meta data such as `title`, `description` and `source` which is displayed next to the player.

## Auto-play (@TODO)

The `autoPlay` property specifies whether the video should be played automatically when becoming visible to user. By setting `autoPlay` to `true` the video automatically starts playing muted and without any ads once visible. When the user `interacts` with the player the video start playing again from start but this time showing the ads as well. To accomplish this we need to have a separate player specified by `playerID2` which does not play any ads.

## major tasks

@TODO: `Caption` component needs to support HTML for `props.description`

@TODO: write unit tests

@TODO: cross-browser E2E tests?

## minor tasks (code fixes)

@TODO4: check kaltura library is only loaded once (is this a problem? Doesn't the browser cache it anyway?)
