# Video component

Videos are using the Kaltura Media Player. The Media Player is used in HTML5 mode per default.

## major tasks

@TODO1: playerID must be handed over by CMS. That's where the playerIDs for all newspapers are configured. Otherwise config should be move to nodeJS layer.

@TODO2: accountID must be stored in global config and be set according to environment (live:1719221, staging:1789881)

@TODO6: refactor & integrate autoplay (use playerID2, discuss with lovely if config stays in their layer)

@TODO7: check responsiveness of player (research), ask hugo/matthew for best practices to make iframes responsible in the current setup

## minor tasks (code fixes)

@TODO4: check kaltura library is only loaded once (is this a problem? Doesn't the browser cache it anyway?)
