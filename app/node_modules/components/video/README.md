# Video component

Videos are using the Kaltura Media Player. The Media Player is used in HTML5 mode per default.

A `video` has to be specified by an `accountID`, a `playerID`, a `kalturaID` for the video to be played as well as corresponding video meta data such as `title`, `description` and `source` which is displayed next to the player.

## Auto-play (@TODO)

The `autoPlay` property specifies whether the video should be played automatically when becoming visible to user. By setting `autoPlay` to `true` the video automatically starts playing muted and without any ads once visible. When the user interacts with the player the video start playing again from start but this time showing the ads as well. To accomplish this we need to have a separate player specified by `playerWithoutAdsID` which does not play any ads.

## major tasks

@TODO: `Caption` component needs to support HTML for `props.description`

@TODO: write unit tests

@TODO: cross-browser E2E tests?

## minor tasks (code fixes)

@TODO4: check kaltura library is only loaded once (is this a problem? Doesn't the browser cache it anyway?)
