# Cover

The `Cover` isomorphic component features an overview under a certain theme e.g. a summary of a Dossier or a Club for example.

For the Newsletter variation, content is set in `helpers/cover/get-newsletter-props.jsx`.

Covers are commonly called via `<tal:>` includes in the CMS for more effective caching. Here data is passed from the relevant API endpoint (depending on the variation) to [`slot.js`](/app/node_modules/components/cover/slot.js), mapped and passed into the component.

**Note:** The `Cover` component with the `dossier` variation is also called from a `teaser--basic` slot in the CMS layout automatically, when a Dossier is added to that slot via the page editor. It then initiates (as a normal isomorphic component) the component's `slot.js` file.
