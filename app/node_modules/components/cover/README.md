# Cover

The `Cover` isomorphic component features an overview under a certain theme e.g. a summary of a Dossier or a Club for example.

Covers are commonly called via `<tal:>` includes in the CMS for more effective caching. Here data is passed from the relevant API endpoint (dependong on the variation) to [`slot.js`](/app/node_modules/components/cover/slot.js), mapped and passed into the component.
