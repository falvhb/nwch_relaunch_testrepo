# Header Nav

This is an isomorphic component which encompasses the main navigation.

If <=IE9 is being used, this component will remain static and scroll with the page. Everything else will get a fixed navigation.

Child components which are used:
- [Primary Nav](/styleguide/components/primary-nav)
- [Meta Nav](/styleguide/components/meta-nav)
- [Header Logo](/styleguide/components/header-nav)
