# Related Videos

The `Related Videos` component shows two relevant videos and one AD at second position. The second slot is always an advertisement, except you've installed an AD-Blocker.

Those videos are called from the `Kaltura API`. This Script including the Modal Video-View is created by `Veeseo`.
