# Audio component

Include Kaltura Media Player to play audio files. The `audio` component is based on the `video` component with its viewing area hidden.

Compared to the `video` component the audio component does not have the `autoPlay` feature.

For documentation on the `audio` components' usage refer to the [`video` component](video).
