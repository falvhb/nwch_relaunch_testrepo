# Ressort Teaser
This widget will be used on the homepage to display selected articles from each of the main ressorts. Expected properties are:
- `title` The ressort title to be used as a subheading
- `ressortUrl` Url path of the full ressort
- `slots` The number of slots to fill. Either 3, 5 or 8.
- `articles` An array of articles.

Additionally, the component makes use of the higher-order component `RessortTeaserBuilder`. In this, it is possible to decorate grid items with anything else, like adverts or sport results.
