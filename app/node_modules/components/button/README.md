# Button

The `Button` component is used to display buttons and links looking like buttons. 

To define whether to display a `<a>` or a `<button>`, the `target` property is used. If passed as a string, it will be treated as the value for the `href` property. If passed as a function, it will be used as an handler when clicking the button.

It is possible to make a secondary button by passing `modifier='secondary'`, which is a direct mapping with a BEM class modifier (`.button--secondary`).

A button can have an icon, using the `icon` property. As of today, the icon can only be on the left of the button label.

To pass extra attributes to the component, such as the `type` or the `target` attributes, it accepts an `attributes` object, that can contain basically anything.
