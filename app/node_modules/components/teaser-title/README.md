# Teaser Title

Renders the title within a `Teaser` component with schema.org `headline` property. Accepts an `icon` property as an identifier for which icon to display before the title. You can also pass a `prefix` and `suffix` properties for additional text before and after the `text` itself. This is useful for prefixing UGC articles with a lable type or suffixing Meinung articles with the Author's name.

Modifiers from the teaser can be passed down to this component as an arry via the `modifiers` property. This allows the byline to be styled correctly based on the teaser format and theme e.g. `class="teaser-byline--light teaser-byline--meinung"`.
