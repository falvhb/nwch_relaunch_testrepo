# Teaser Switchable

An extension of the `Teaser` component and also commonly included via `<tal:>` includes in the CMS. The `TeaserSwitchable` component displays a Teaser which changes variation based on the viewport. An example of this is when teasers are listed in a Dossier or on the Thema page.

Currently there are two switchable Teaser variations:

- `inlined-left-to-basic`: switches from `inlined-left` to `basic` e.g. for use in grids
- `listed-to-summary`: switches from `listed` to `summary` e.g. for use in the latest articles section

Data is transformed and mapped using the `getTeaserSwitchableFromArticle` helper in `helpers/teaser` which combines the data required for both variations.

You can set configuration for all switchable Teaser variations and set their breakpoints in the file `getSwitchableConfig` in `helpers/teaser`.
