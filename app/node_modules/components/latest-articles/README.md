# Latest Articles

Call the latest articles from the CMS layout displayed in a widget, showing `Teaser` components in the `listed` variation. The featured teaser used the `TeaserSwitchable` component in variation `listed-to-summary` for changing the view on mobile.

The API is automatically requested via the node route and the following variations are available:

```
## list news and UGC articles
<tal:metal replace="structure context/@@nodeview/latest/latest-articles/default"/>

## list only UGC articles
<tal:metal replace="structure context/@@nodeview/latest/latest-articles/news"/>

## list only UGC articles
<tal:metal replace="structure context/@@nodeview/latest/latest-articles/ugc"/>
```

The desktop count of 9 articles are passed to the component as props but only 5 are rendered server-side. The component then enhances the widget to 9 articles on wider viewports.

In future, this component is intended to also contain **Popular Articles** in a second tab (when the API is available). In this case an `array` can be passed as the `articles` property with the section / tab config being set at the top of the component's `wrapper.jsx`.
