// This file is intended to provide a friendly API to components as they can
// just use `@import 'globals'` at the top without having to import each helper
// individually.
//
// /!\ Caution! Make sure this file never outputs any CSS on its own as it gets
// included by all components from the application. Any CSS output by this file
// will be duplicated in each component. Definitely not what you want.
