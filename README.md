## Development

### Styleguide

When working in the styleguide, on http://localhost:8000

```sh
$ gulp assets
$ gulp
```

### Back-end

When working with back-end integration, on http://localhost:8801.


```sh
$ gulp assets --production
$ gulp --production
```

For full documentation of setting up this local development environment please see [localdev](localdev).

### Note

`gulp assets` compiles static assets to save them being compiled on every watch. Do this once, every time you start developing or update something in `/assets`.

## API

We use the Lovely Systems API for recieving data. Documentation can be found here:
http://api-azdev.lovelysystems.com/docs/

## Branching

We use the [Git Flow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow/) branching model. `master` **always** contains the current, tested live version.

When working, create feature branches off `develop` in the form `feature/8-story-name` where `8` is the user story number and `story-name` is the name of the user story (both from ScrumDo).

## Code Quality

Before committing, code will be linted using `eslint` (JS/JSX) and `scss-lint` (Scss). You will not be able to commit unless your code passes linting. To make life easier, use plugins for your text editor to highlight any errors as you go e.g.

- [Sublime​Linter](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/SublimeLinter)
- [SublimeLinter-scss-lint](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/SublimeLinter-contrib-scss-lint)
- [Sublime​Linter-contrib-eslint](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/SublimeLinter-contrib-eslint)

You might also find the following useful for this project:

- [babel-sublime](https://github.com/babel/babel-sublime)


## Deployment

Check you have access to the Heroku app (ask Moritz) then add a Heroku remote to your repository.

```sh
$ git remote add heroku git@heroku.com:az-nwch.git
```

For reference, we are using [this buildpack](https://github.com/robgraeber/heroku-buildpack-nodejs-bower-gulp) for Node / Gulp configuration.

To deploy, the following command will deploy from the `master` branch

```sh
$ git push heroku master
```

If you want to deploy from a specific/feature branch, use:

```sh
$ git push heroku branchname:master
```

## Lovely Systems Deployment

Currently the deployment is made using git checkout from branch "release/0.0".

To prepare the current develop branch for deployement use these commands::

```sh
$ git checkout develop
$ git pull
$ git checkout release/0.0
$ git merge develop
$ npm version patch
$ git push origin
```
